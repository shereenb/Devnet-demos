Are you tired of waiting for the next big LLM release to get better AI results? Here we will take the exact same LLMs you're already using and show you how to achieve  better performance through pure architectural optimization. 

What You'll Learn & Implement:
* Understand why autonomous agent architecture is revolutionizing AI performance.
* Learn to create specialized agents and orchestrate workflow (agent_workflow.py)
